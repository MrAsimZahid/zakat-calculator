Zakat on cash is straightforward as it is fully liquid and immediately accessible.

%
=
Zakat Due
Total Cash×2.5%=Zakat Due
Steps to Calculate Zakat on Cash:
Identify all cash holdings:

Cash on hand (physical money in your possession).
Checking account balance.
Savings account balance.
Any other bank deposits that you can withdraw freely.
Foreign currency holdings (converted to a single currency).
Convert foreign currencies to your local currency at the prevailing exchange rate.

Total all cash and cash-equivalents.

Total Cash
=
(
Cash on hand
+
Checking account balance
+
Savings account balance
+
Other cash holdings
)
Total Cash=(Cash on hand+Checking account balance+Savings account balance+Other cash holdings)
Apply the Zakat rate (2.5%).

0.025
Zakat Due=Total Cash×0.025
Example Calculation:
Cash Source	Amount (USD)
Cash on hand	500
Checking account	2,000
Savings account	5,500
Foreign currency (converted)	1,000
Total Cash	9,000
Zakat Due (2.5%)	225
Key Notes:
No deductions are made for expenses or debts from cash before Zakat calculation.
Zakat is due on all accessible cash, regardless of whether it is being used or saved.
If cash balance fluctuates, use the amount on the annual Zakat due date.
Emergency funds are not exempt unless inaccessible.

# Gold & Silver Calculator Guidelines

## 1. Core Principles
âœ… You only pay on gold & silver you fully own and control.

- Personal jewelry may be exempt, depending on interpretation.
- Gold/silver held as an investment (coins, bars, bullion) is always Zakat-liable.
âœ… The total gold/silver must meet or exceed the Nisab threshold.

- Gold Nisab: 85 grams
- Silver Nisab: 595 grams
- Zakat is due if your total holdings exceed either threshold in its respective metal.
âœ… You pay 2.5% of the total market value.

- Use the market price on your Zakat calculation day.
- Formula:
(
TotalÂ GoldÂ Value
+
TotalÂ SilverÂ Value
)
Ã—
2.5
%
=
ZakatÂ Due
(TotalÂ GoldÂ Value+TotalÂ SilverÂ Value)Ã—2.5%=ZakatÂ Due
âœ… Zakat is due on gold/silver held for one full lunar year.

- If you just acquired gold/silver within the last year, it is not yet Zakat-liable.

## 2. Considerations
ðŸ’¡ Owned by you:

- Gold/silver given on loan or consignment is not included in your Zakat.
- If you own it jointly, you calculate only your share.

ðŸ’¡ In your full control:

- If gold/silver is held in a safety deposit box or vault, it is still considered in your possession.
- Gold-backed investments (e.g., ETFs, digital gold) may be liable for Zakat, depending on accessibility.

ðŸ’¡ Above basic needs:

- Wedding rings and personal jewelry are sometimes exempt (scholarly differences exist).
- Gold/silver used purely as an asset (investment, stored bullion, etc.) is always Zakat-liable.

ðŸ’¡ Held for one full lunar year:

- If you acquired new gold/silver within the last year, you wait until a full lunar year has passed before paying Zakat on it.
